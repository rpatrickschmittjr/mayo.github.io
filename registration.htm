      <P>Residents, businesses, or organizations in Mayo, Maryland may register a 
      domain name under <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B>.  There may be a nominal fee <A 
      href="http://mayo.md.us/registration.htm#note">(*)</A>. 
      <P>You may have either a delegated subdomain such as 
      <B><I>YOUR-NAME.MAYO.MD.US</I></B> (requires your own DNS server) or merely 
      several domain name resource records ("RRs"; for when you have no 
      nameserver of your own). Some names are reserved for the community and
      local entities. This is as per the rules at the <A href="http://www.nic.us/">US
      Domain NIC</A>.  
      <P>By registering a domain name under <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B>, you acquire 
      nothing more than the use of the domain name. It does not include an email address
      or a website. To arrange for a website at that domain name or to receive email 
      at that address, you need to either have your own mail or web server (with a                    dedicated Internet connection) or you need to arrange with an ISP to host 
      the domain. 
      <P>To register a domain, send an email to <A 
      href="mailto:hostmaster@mayo.md.us">hostmaster....atasign....mayo.md.us</A>. 
      Please give some identification to show residency or location in Mayo, Maryland, the 
      subdomain name you are requesting, and the specifics of your subdomain.  
      Please include the hostnames and IP addresses of two independent DNS servers.
      (If you need a primary or secondary DNS server, consider something like <A 
        href="http://www.granitecanyon.com/">The Public DNS</A>). 
        <P></P>
      <P> All domain registrations will have a <I>Responsible Person</I> 
      resource record included with the owners email address. 
      <P>Most requests are processed within 48-hours of receipt.
      I promise that all approved requests will be processed within 
      two weeks.  This is not a 24-hour per day service, and I may not always be available
      to respond. so please be patient. 
      <P>

      <P>Unlike many other locality domains, the <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B> 
      domain name is run on a volunteer basis by a resident of Mayo, Maryland. 
      <P>To contact me, email me at <A 
      href="mailto:pschmitt@mayo.md.us">pschmitt....atasign....mayo.md.us</A>. 
      <P>In 2000, I wanted to register my personal Unix system at the <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B>
      domain. Because it didn't exist, I decided to apply for the mayo.md.us domain
      delegation, so that I could register my system in it and make it easily available
      to others who also wished to do so and to prevent a commercial enterprise from
      this domain and commercializing it.  I operate the servers for
      <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B> as a community service.  Registrations under             <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B> are available to all residents, businesses, and
      organizations in Mayo, Maryland.
      
      <P>

      <P><A name=note>*</A>There may be fee for registration of Domain names requested 	by residents, businesses and organizations. 
      <P>Requests to register domain names <I>by a third party registrar</I> 
      will not be accepted. All registrations must be direct.  All of 
      the goods and services being used to support the <B><I>MAYO.MD.US</I></B> 
      domain are being furnished by various entities. Allowing a third-party to 
      profit by positioning itself between these providers of services and the 
      end-user would be a violation of the agreements under which the service 
      providers are making their services available.  This is a not-for-profit community
      service.
